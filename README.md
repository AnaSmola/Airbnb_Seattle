## Exploring Relationships between Variables
Analyzing the correlation matrix, it can be observed that with an increase in availability, the price tends to increase. 
Additionally, the number of beds and the number of people the accommodation can accommodate show a strong positive correlation. 
This suggests that properties offering more sleeping places often have higher prices, which may be associated with higher rental costs for larger spaces.
